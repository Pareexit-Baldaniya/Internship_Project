Minor differences can arise from different weight initializations, optimizer implementations, or slight variations in data augmentation pipelines.\n",

    "2.  **Training Speed:** Training time is also generally comparable. TensorFlow's `tf.data` pipeline is highly optimized and can sometimes give it a slight edge, especially on TPUs. However, PyTorch's `DataLoader` with `num_workers` is also very efficient. The exact hardware (GPU type, CPU speed) and library versions can influence these results.\n",

    "    - You are working in a research environment or need to implement novel, complex architectures.\n",

    "    - You want maximum control and flexibility over the training process and find it easier to debug.\n",
